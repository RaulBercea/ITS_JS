## Excercise Requirements

Using the babies array from the previous exercise:

-   Write a getBabyOutfit() function that returns a description a baby's outfit
    -   e.g "Lyla is wearing a blue shirt and red pants and a green hat"
-   Write a feedBaby() function that prints what a baby is eating
    -   e.g. "Lyla is eating food3, food1, food4 and food2"
    -   All foods in favoriteFoods should appear but randomly each time the function is called
-   Run both function on all the babies

## Aproach to Solution

each object and manipulate it. in this case getting all of the outfits
and favorite foods of the babies and forming sentences based on each of
them
