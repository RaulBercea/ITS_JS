## Excercise requirements

-   Add an external javascript file called main.js
-   In JavaScript:

        - Change the body style so it has a font-family of "Arial, sans-serif"

        - Replace each of the spans (nickname, favorites, hometown) with your
        own information

        - Iterate through each li and change the class to "list-item"

        - Create a new img element and set its src attribute to a picture of you

        - Append that element to the page

-   Add an external css file using Javascript

        - The external css file should make items with the .list-item class
        white, bold and with an
        orange background

        - The external css file should be applied after 4 seconds

## Aproach to solution

By using various methods for manipulating the dom in javascript i've
modified the content of an html page.

By using the `.style` proptiety i can style the element using css rules.

by using the `.getElementsByTagName` and `.getElementById` proprieties i can
manipulate an element within the document by finding it's tag or id

by using the `.createElement` propriety and the `body.appendChild` proprieties i can add html tags to the page with javascript
