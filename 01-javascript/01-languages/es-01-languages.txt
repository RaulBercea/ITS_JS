Compiled Languages:

	- java: 
		java can be considered both a compiled and interpreted language at the same time.
		It is considered compiled because javac(the compiler used by java) first compiles 
		the source code into a binary file, then the binary file runs on the Java Virtual
		Machine wich is usualy a softwere based interpreter

	- c:	
		c as a language is meant to be minimalist and efficient, as such it is very close
		to the machine and uses compilers(such as GCC) to crate very efficient code.
		Because of it's efficiency it's used as the main language of the UNIX system

	- c++:	
		C++ is a general purpose language mostly meant for desktop applications. it's code
		can be compiled using a variety of compilers such as: GCC, minGW or VisualC++

	- Swift:
		Swift is a language used for developement for the Apple ecosystem, it uses the LLVM
		compiler availabe in Xcode
	- c#:
		C# is another general purpose programming language developed by Microsoft it uses
		the compilers included in the .NET Framework to run

Interpreted Languages

	- javascript:
		Javascript is a programming language meant for client-side web applications, as such
		it is interpreted by the web browser used by the user(for example Chrom or Firefox)

	- php:
		PHP as a language is meant for server-side web applications wich means the interpreter
		is a browser application

	- SQL:
		SQL is meant as a programming language used to insert,modify or delete data from a
		database. It is run server-side using an interpreter
	
	- python: 
		Python is a general purpose programming language, it uses a virtual machine as it's
		interpreter meaning that it is software that emulates a physical computer
