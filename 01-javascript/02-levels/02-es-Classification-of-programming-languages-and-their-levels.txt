Programming Languages are formal languages used to create computer programs. They are comprised of sets of instructions that can genereate various outputs and create specific algorithms.

Programming languages are divided in three different categories:
	
	- Machine Language:    	This is the language used by the computer's hardware, it is made up by a series of zeros and ones that are used to represent the operations that
							are accomplished by the computer.

	- Assembly Language:   	Assembly languages are comprised of pneumonic abbreviations of the binary instructions used by the machine as such they are unique for each 
							machine since the code created with them needs to be translated to machine language using what is called an assembler

	- High-level Language: 	High-level Languages, such as Java or C++ are written to be more like English using English words for their instructions, that makes is so the 
							programmer can more easily read, write and understand the code. High-level languages use compilers and interpreters to translate the code to machine language.
