# The pros And Cons of Using A CDN

## What is a CDN?

To put it simply a CDN(Content delivery network) is a network of servers located in data centers around the globe. Their purpose is to cache your websites content(for example the HTML pages, images, videos and JavaScript files) so that when the user acceses the website from a certain location they will have access to the website and it's content from a location that is closer to them geographicaly.

## Pros of Using a CDN

- 100% availability:
By using a CDN the trafic on your website is distributed to hundreds of CDN's servers by doing that the CDN ensures that the trafic to the origin server is protected and thus it won't have to face any downtime.

- Fast Delivery of Content
Since the CNDs are placed closer to the user they will have access to the website from a CDN located nearest to them. This makes the access to the websites much faster for the user since he will interact with a CDN that is geographically closer to him

- More reliable delivery of Content
With the use of a CDN the delivery of higher resolution content (such as videos and images) is much more consistent, this makes the users happier as they can have access to higher resolution content consistently.

- Control over asset delivery
When a CDN monitors your asset delivery, operators can determine where extra capacity is needed, based on real-time statistics. If the server in a certain region is suffering from overload, operators can provide extra bandwidth to make sure that everything is running smoothly.

## Cons of Using a CDN

- The Costs
Probabbly the most significant downside of using a CDN. Since the CDN uses third-party networks since the company needs to install such a networt they also need to interact with other companies.

- Restrictions
In some countries the ip adresses of popular CDNs(som organizations also do this) this makes you lose some trafic from such countries to your website

- Support Availability
In case your CDN is managed by a third party vendor in case of any technical issue you can't know how long it will take to fix it

- Loss of Control
If the CDN goes out of busines or if the serice becomes unavailable it's impossible to use your CDN and fall back to local files. This may not be a common issue but it is still a risk that needs to be taken into account.

## Scenarios where a CDN is required
1. In case your website has a lot of traffic
