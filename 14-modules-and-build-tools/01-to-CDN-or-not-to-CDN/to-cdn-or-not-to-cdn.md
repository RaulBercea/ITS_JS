# The pros And Cons of Using A CDN

## What is a CDN?

To put it simply a CDN(Content delivery network) is a network of servers located in data centers around the globe. Their purpose is to cache your websites content(for example the HTML pages, images, videos and JavaScript files) so that when the user acceses the website from a certain location they will have access to the website and it's content from a location that is closer to them geographicaly.

## Pros of Using a CDN

- 100% availability:
By using a CDN the trafic on your website is distributed to hundreds of CDN's servers by doing that the CDN ensures that the trafic to the origin server is protected and thus it won't have to face any downtime.

- Fast Delivery of Content
Since the CNDs are placed closer to the user they will have access to the website from a CDN located nearest to them. This makes the access to the websites much faster for the user since he will interact with a CDN that is geographically closer to him

- More reliable delivery of Content
With the use of a CDN the delivery of higher resolution content (such as videos and images) is much more consistent, this makes the users happier as they can have access to higher resolution content consistently.

- Control over asset delivery
When a CDN monitors your asset delivery, operators can determine where extra capacity is needed, based on real-time statistics. If the server in a certain region is suffering from overload, operators can provide extra bandwidth to make sure that everything is running smoothly.

## Cons of Using a CDN

- The Costs
Probabbly the most significant downside of using a CDN. Since the CDN uses third-party networks since the company needs to install such a networt they also need to interact with other companies.

- Restrictions

- Support Availability

- Loss of Control
