## Exercise Requirements

-   Use jsonblob to store JSON data about cars and a car factory
-   You can use as many blobs as you need. Decide the structure in a way to reduce the amount of data you modify with HTTP requests
-   Write an application that displays a factory with a list of cars
-   Clicking on each car should display a collapsible panel with more information about the car
-   It should be possible to edit the car details
-   Save the modified data to jsonblob with an HTTP request
-   Whenever data is modified you should reload the new data from jsonblob once the writing has finished
-   You should handle all error cases in your application. If an HTTP request fails, you should display a message to the user
-   Your project should include a folder called ‘json’ with all the initial json files that you upload to jsonblob (the initial state of your DB)
-   Your readme (markdown) should include links to all the jsonblobs that you are using as well as a list of their IDs
